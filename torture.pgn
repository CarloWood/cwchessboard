		The PGN Torture File, by Carlo Wood © 2008

% This file tests about ever error a human can make in creating
% a PGN input file. The file is NOT legal PGN, but a test case
% that allows the parsers coders to be aware of the rubish they
% might run into.

First we start with illegal junk BEFORE the first [Tagname "value]
pair. Note you don't want to detect the start of the tag section
at the first '[', but you should wait till you see an empty line
IF and ONLY IF you see junk that is NOT white space after an empty
line.
% The following line misses a ", but because it is not preceeded
% by an empty line, the line should be rejected (and the string
% terminated at the end of the line).
[Note "this means this is not a tag pair!] If only because it's
badly formatted (perhaps a good format, '['<tagname> <blanks> <string> ']'
SHOULD start the tag section.

Ok, lets start for real now.

% Lines that start with a '%' are escaped lines and should be
% COMPLETELY ignored. Hence, the following line should appear
% to start after the previous empty line, and really start the
% tag section. The '=' is illegal here, but we accept it because
% there was an empty line before this line.
[Event = "The PGN Torture File, by Carlo Wood (c) 2008"]
% After the first tag pair, empty lines are just white space,
% and you can add as many as you like:

% Also, you can just leave them out:
[Custom_tag "Custom tag"][Another_custom_tag "Another custom tag"]

% Sometimes people even forget to add spaces:
[WhiteElo"2000"]
% Or add too many:
[
  BlackElo		"1850"	
  ] ; Adding a comment here is illegal by the way.
  [ { Adding a comment like this, here, as well }
% Escaped lines can appear anywhere were whitespace can appear.
tagname_should_start_with_an_upper_case_letter_but_do_not_always{
[Now who would add a comment like that?!]}""]
% That was an empty string; in many cases it should be translated
% into "-"...
% The following tests the stupidity of adding a colon or equal
% sign after the tag-name:
[Annotator: "Me, guess who added the colon there!"]
[Annotator="It's not allowed to repeat the same tagname twice,
but what would I know? After all, I appear not even to know
that it's illegal to use new-lines inside strings!"]

% PGN should be ISO-8859/1. But escaped lines can contain ANYTHING  of course.
[Result:"1/2" {This should really be "1/2-1/2"}]
% Actually, strings are allowed to contain high-ascii values.
% The following is nonsense and should result in the result '*'.
% Or better yet, be replaced with the result that is used to
% terminate the game.
[Result: "½-½"]
% Actually, strings might as well contain illegal characters.
% It's best to translate those into question marks ('?').

; Also comments, which do not nest (-:{, can contain  etc.
{ What to do with comments in between tag pairs? Just move
them to below the Tag Pairs 40. Qe8 ±, I guess... and also here:
note¹ §4.3.}

{ There can be a comment before the game starts. }
{ Multiple comments, in fact.

Since we had a FEN tag, it is blacks move at this point!
We do not start with move 1 here. }

13 .. Kg7 14 O-O Ne5 15 Bg3
{The knight on e5 keeps all of black defences together.
Had white not played 13. Bb5 but instead to e2 or d3 then
black could have maintained himself with 15 .. Nc6}
% A move number can be followed by a period, or not, and
% when it's blacks move, the ellipsis can be from two till
% four periods, hence we can have:
15.. Ng6 16. gh6+
% or
16..... Rh6: 17 Rf7+!
% or
17. ... Kxf7
% of course. Note it's illegal to use colon to annotate
% that one captured a piece... but...
18 Qh6: ab5
% Sometimes variations are empty, in which case they
% should be ignored. Well, mostly they contain a comment
% in that case.
